       "894      i like the ease of creating different to do lists, ability to create subtasks, and that i can make my grocery shopping list according to what store i shop at. it's great that the grocery list are automatically sorted by aisle for you. however, i noticed that if i add a price to the beginning or end of the grocery item, that it gets put in the 'other' aisle category. i also like how you can switch something in one list to a different one just by tapping on it. nice work \n",
       "16076      i really like this app - its a lovely interface, simple to use and very useful to have both tasks and notes with the calendar. is there any possibility of adding a folder/tag/category function to the notes?  it would be so helpful - i make notes on a varietu of things as i go along, and its really useful to be able to store them by day, but it would also be great to be able to sort them by tags or folders. anyway - just a suggestion. otherwise a lovely app. thanks :-)\n",
